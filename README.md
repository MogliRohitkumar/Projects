Academic projects
1. Auto Light-Detecting solar panel
-> Created a robotic arm that automatically rotates Solar panels 360 degrees by detecting the sunrise.
-> Utilized Arduino UNO software to program the robotic arm using C language.
-> Used Photo resistors to detect the amount of sunlight received by solar panels. This photo resistor value is used to rotate the solar panel.

2. Touch free timer circuit
-> This type of infrared proximity circuit is widely used as an electric switch where physical contact is not desired for hygiene purposes.
-> Can be operated by moving your hand in front of it. It has two sections transmitter and receive
-> Achieved by detecting the infrared light reflected by your hand onto a receiver device.
